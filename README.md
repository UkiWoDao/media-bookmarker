# media-bookmarker


A small bookmarker-like app that saves entries in a mongo database, dynamically creates the list on the front end, and allows for basic manipulation of the list

## Prerequisites

This app uses node.js with npm and mongoDB

### Installing

Once you have node and npm installed, install the dependencies by navigating to the folder containing the app in the terminal and running

```
npm install
```

This will install body-parser, express, express-handlebars and mongoose packages

Feel free to play around with it.
